      <h1>History of HRVPRD</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1948: Pool is built on its current site by the City of Hood River.</li>
        <li>1988: Hood River County voters approve formation of The Hood River Valley Parks & Recreation District (HRVPRD) to save the 1940’s era pool when the City decided to shut it down. HRVPRD becomes a special purpose government entity & begins collecting taxes, separate from the city or county.</li>
        <li>1992: Voters expand the Parks & Recreation District Charter, giving the authority to manage parks and trails, but they did not increase the tax rate.</li>
        <li>1997: Oregon tax law changed with Measures 50, which froze all taxing rates in the state permanently and required future measures to be approved by voters. HRVPRD’s tax rate is $0.3498 per $1,000 assessed, which is one of the lowest in the state.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>7 New Parks built by HRVPRD in last 25 years: Rotary Skate Park, Odell Community Park, Golden Eagle, Culbertson, Hazelview, Barrett and Morrison Park.</li>
        <li>6 new miles of trails added, including Indian Creek Trail & the Westside Trail.</li>
        <li>34 acres of future park land and trails secured through state & federal grants and property developers to support the growing population.</li>
        <li>Community Recreation Offerings Revitalized: HRVPRD took over recreation programming (sports, day camps, enrichment) from the school district. In 2023, there were over 3200 local enrollments in these programs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The pool is in urgent need of replacement: Any major malfunction in the competition pool filter, the boiler, tent walls, or pipes will cause immediate closures and costly repairs.</li>
        <li>Funds from the Hood River County School District to support Recreation offerings will end in September of 2024.</li>
        <li>The community guided Parks Master Plan identified needs: more parks, fields, natural areas, trail connections, & indoor recreation space. The current tax rate, one of the lowest Parks and Rec District rates in the state, cannot support any significant new park development.</li>
        <li>HRV Parks and Recreation currently owns no multi-purpose rooms, gyms, or fields, making recreation scheduling and access limited.</li>
      </ul>
