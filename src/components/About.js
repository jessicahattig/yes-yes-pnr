          <p className="lead">For the sustained operation and maintenance of Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District (HRVPRD), we propose an Operational Levy. This levy, with a length of 5 years and a tax rate of $0.43 per $1,000 assessed value, ensures the continuity of essential services. The estimated annual cost for the average household is $94, contributing to the care of public resources, increased maintenance demands, and the operation of an expanded pool within a community center.</p>

          <h2 className="mb-4 custom-heading">General Obligation Bond</h2>
          <p className="lead">In addition to the Operational Levy, we seek support for a General Obligation Bond. This 25-year initiative, with a tax rate of $1.27 per $1,000 assessed value, aims to fund significant projects, including the construction of a new pool with a community center and recreation space. The bond will also facilitate the development of Westside Park, the purchase and preservation of Parkdale Park, and the construction of key trail connections. The estimated annual cost for the average household is $279, contributing to the enhancement of recreational facilities and the overall well-being of the community.</p>

      <h2>Community Engagement & Solution Finding</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>2017: Pool Study found the pool had 3-5 years
          left of useful life & gave options for replacement.</p>
        <p>2020: Parks Master Plan created & accepted by
          HRVPRD, City, County, Port, & School District,
          with significant community input.</p>
        <p>2021 Westside Park Study determined whether
          land was suitable for a park. Results of study &
          feedback led HRVPRD board to purchase the 20
          acres identified in Parks Master Plan for future park development.</p>
        <p>2017-2023 - Extensive Community Input
          received through stakeholder interviews,
          multiple English & Spanish focus groups, tabling
          events, local group meetings, online surveys,
          open houses, & two statistically valid surveys.</p>
        <p>2023: HRVPRD Board considers multiple
          packages and funding measures to address
          community needs. (Pool with community center,
          trails, park improvements, recreation).</p>
        <p>Combination of two ballot measures are referred to voters or the May 2024 election.</p>
