Notes from Christy
Hi Jessica,
Thanks so much for your willingness to create the Yes Yes for Parks and Rec website! I am another board member (with Mike) and am the campaign manager for the measures. To help avoid the game of telephone, Mike gave me your email so I could reach out directly. There are a few key updates for you:

1) Logo/Styling: As Mike hopefully shared last week, we have a "logo" of sorts. (The election sign, attached). That should serve as the basis for the styling of the site.

2) Informational Content: I'll send you INFORMATIONAL materials after the board meeting tonight, for reference and to help you get started on content. Please note these are materials for the "District" not for the "Political Action Committee," hence their different styling. These are not to upload, but you can pull info from them. 

3) Convincing Content: The campaign team is meeting next on Thursday. We hope to hone in on key messages at that point. Those ideas would then need to get integrated into the campaign website.
(As I think you know, the District Website will provide neutral information about the measures but the PAC website is more about trying to make the case for voting Yes-Yes).

4) Images: We finally got photos. They're being added to this folder throughout today. Please note some are better than others - please use the better ones.

5) Previewing the site: Would you be able to give the campaign team a "viewing" link or screenshots of what you have so far for the website, so we can provide feedback? 

Do you have any questions for me? I can also be reached by phone at 408-834-9010 which may be easier for some questions than email.
